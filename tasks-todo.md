What's left to do on the tasks/backlog PR?

- [ ] Write backlog file
  - [ ] optional: Clean file writing
    - maybe not actually going to implement this with the PR, but as we will need to write the backlog, we should _eventually_ revisit how we write day files etc.
- [ ] fix scroll
- [ ] optional: improve scaling / use of space
